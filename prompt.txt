I am teaching 100 days python course . Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Strings Slicing and Operations on Strings in Python .mp3","Number":"12","start":16.5,"end":18.9,"text":" Today I will tell you about string slicing"},{"title":"Strings Slicing and Operations on Strings in Python .mp3","Number":"12","start":3.2,"end":6.2,"text":" And today's topic is how to do string slicing"},{"title":"Strings Slicing and Operations on Strings in Python .mp3","Number":"12","start":46.0,"end":50.0,"text":" And today we are going to see how string slicing is done"},{"title":"Strings Slicing and Operations on Strings in Python .mp3","Number":"12","start":548.0,"end":550.0,"text":" So this way string slicing can be done"},{"title":"Strings Slicing and Operations on Strings in Python .mp3","Number":"12","start":336.0,"end":338.0,"text":" So this is how slicing works"}]
---------------------------------
"Where is slicing of string is taught ?"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
